# TODO
* Add stuff from 2add296ba8679c09365b1ff3947e9092142832c8
  * `entity_exists` mock and fix tests for that
  * From PR desc: 'added support for calling get_state without using any entity_id'
    * Not 100% sure what this means, circle back on this
  * others in this PR were already implemented with tests on my branch
    * `run_at`
